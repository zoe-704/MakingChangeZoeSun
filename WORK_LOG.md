| Jan 26 |  1245-145pm   | During class today I was discussing with Lily and also listening to the whole class discussion about this problem set. Lily and I were thinking of an approach that breaks the problem down into various trees and goes through all possible combinations except this includes repetitive sequences. I was also thinking of working backwards except I recognize that that would overall be the same as working forwards. I was primarily thinking about this as counting how many ways to make like 0 cents from the given coins and then using that to calculate 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents, etc. all the way up to n cents. Mr. Blick gave us a hint in class today to think about using less coin values to break this problem down and use dp, which is what I am going to continue thinking about. I remember I solved this problem over a year ago when I first learned dp but I highkey forgot how to do it. |

I keep getting index out of bounds error, so there's some sort of bug I need to fix. Now I am getting significantly larger answers than expected (127101770 vs -1621630291 or 114523189 vs 5621927), so I need to resolve some sort of overcounting mistake also resulting in overflow at times. |

However, the code doesn't work yet, so I still need to debug this and implement memoization. |

I also forgot to initialize the row in the 2d array to be 1 when building the 2d array. However, the test cases return a value slightly less than the expected values except for testcorrectlargest. |

I forgot to adjust the index of what I return from the function after adjusting the indexes of my for loops. I also didn't make the 2d array long values. I made the code all pretty. I'm gonig to bed now. |

I still found that my original 1D dp tabulation approach is still the most efficient. 2d memoization: 18-27 s, 2d tabulation: 15-19s, 1d tabulation: 15-22s (16s-21s w/ sorting) |
