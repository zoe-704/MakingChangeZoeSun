| Jan 26 | 1245-145pm | During class today I was discussing with Lily and also listening to the whole class discussion about this problem set. Lily and I were thinking of an approach that breaks the problem down into various trees and goes through all possible combinations except this includes repetitive sequences. I was also thinking of working backwards except I recognize that that would overall be the same as working forwards. I was primarily thinking about this as counting how many ways to make like 0 cents from the given coins and then using that to calculate 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents, etc. all the way up to n cents. Mr. Blick gave us a hint in class today to think about using less coin values to break this problem down and use dp, which is what I am going to continue thinking about. I remember I solved this problem over a year ago when I first learned dp but I highkey forgot how to do it. |

I keep getting index out of bounds error, so there's some sort of bug I need to fix. Now I am getting significantly larger answers than expected (127101770 vs -1621630291 or 114523189 vs 5621927), so I need to resolve some sort of overcounting mistake also resulting in overflow at times. |

However, the code doesn't work yet, so I still need to debug this and implement memoization. |
